    "#### =>> Employee Salary Hike Percentage = More Number of Employees whose salary hike percentage belongs to 11-19 % are getting 2 & 3 performance rating Maximum time as well as Employees whose salary hike percentage is in between 20-22%, There performance rating is 4\n",
    "#### =>> Experience Years In CurrentRole = In EmpWorkLifeBalance, level 3 is showing high Performance Rating of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) A Trained model which can predict the Employee Performance :-\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The trained model is created using the machine learning algorithm as follows with the accuracy score,\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) Random Forest Classifier (With Hyperparameter Tuning)=>>[97.62%]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Recommendations to improve the Employee Performance :-\n",
    "\n",
    "#### =>> The overall employee performance can be achieved by employee environment satisfaction. The company needs to focus more on the employee environment satisfaction.\n",
    "#### =>> The salary hike will give the boost to the employees to perform well.\n",
    "#### =>> Promote the employee ervery 6th month\n",
    "#### =>> Improve Employee's work-life balance this affects the performance rating.\n",
    "#### =>> While recruiting for HR, consider the female candidates where they perform well compared to male.\n",
    "#### =>> The development and sales department is having an overall higher performance comparing to rest of the departments. While some of the employees who gives feedback like Low & Medium from Job Satisfaction & Relationship Satisfaction feature, such employees gives Excellent performance more in number. So company should focus on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Conclusion :-\n",
    "### By observing the results, I came to a conclusion that Random Forest Classifier gives better accuracy score as compare to other model i,e. 97.62% which is far better than others algorithms. And its mean squared error is 0.069  which is very less because less error means its a generlized working model."
