The Project which is given here is an Employee Performance Analysis, which is a classification problem because the target variable consist of ordinal data.
The given dataset consist of 1200 rows & 28 columns. The shape of the dataset is [1200x28].
The 28 features are classified into Numerical and Categorical where 19 features are Numerical (11 columns consists numeric data & 8 columns consists ordinal data) and 8 features are Categorical.
EmpNumber consist alphanumerical data (distinct values) which doesn't play a role as a relevant feature for performance rating, thats why we encode it into simple numbers.
From Correlation the important aspects of the data correlation between features and Performance Rating.
Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related.The analysis of the project has gone through the stage of Univariate,Bivariate & Multivariate analysis, correlation analysis and analysis by each department to satisfy the project goal.
